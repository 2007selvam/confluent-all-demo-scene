# Generate Test Data with Kafka Connect
docker-compose files from Producing Sample Kafka Data Meetup

## Description

This directory contains two sub-directories with docker-compose files for either the DataGen or Voluble source connectors.  The files are aimed at running the connect workers locally but producing data to Confluent Cloud.


## Running the demo

Before you can run these files with docker-compose, you will need to fill in the values for {{CCLOUD_ENDPOINT}}, {{CCLOUD_KEY}}, {CCLOUD_SECRET}, {{SCHEMA_REGISTRY_URL}}, {{SR_KEY}}, and {{SR_SECRET}}. 


Note: If you are producing data to Kafka brokers other than Confluent Cloud, you can change these variables as needed.
